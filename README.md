### Page set up and Switching Pages

Managing page navigation is a common task in web testing. Please refer to the [Pages section](docs/FrameworkSetup.md#switching-pages) for techniques and examples on how to set up a page and switch between different pages within your tests.

## Usage

### Page Objects

Page objects are utilized to encapsulate information about the elements present on each page of your application. They also provide a structured way to write action and assertion functions for various functionalities on each page. This approach promotes code reusability and makes the tests easier to maintain and understand. Page objects can be found in the `pages` directory.

Here's an example of a page object under the `pages` package:

### Running Tests via the Command-Line Interface

Utilize a variety of commands to execute your tests in different modes. Below are a few illustrative examples:

#### npm run commands


```bash
npm run test
``

For more information, please refer to the [Playwright CLI documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli).

## Report Generation and Viewing

Playwright Test offers several built-in reporters tailored for various requirements, along with the flexibility to integrate custom reporters. You can configure these reporters either through the command line or within the `playwright.config.ts` file. For a comprehensive guide on Playwright's in-built reporters, refer to the official [documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters).

### Accessing Reports via Command-Line Interface (CLI)

- **Playwright command**: After executing tests, you can view the reports using the following command:

```bash
npx playwright show-report <path to the report>
```

- **Framework Configured script**: This framework's configuration for viewing reports is defined in the `package.json` under the `scripts` section:

```json
"report": "playwright show-report playwright-report"
```

To access the reports post-test execution using this configuration, run:

```bash
npm run report
```

## Additional Playwright Features

- **UI Mode**: Playwright's UI mode allows you to explore, run, and debug tests in a watch mode. Dive deeper into this feature [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode).

- **Test Generator**: With Playwright, you can automatically generate tests. It inspects the page to determine the optimal locator, prioritizing by role, text, and test ID locators. Learn more about test generation using Codegen [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen).

- **Trace Viewer**: The Playwright Trace Viewer offers a graphical interface to review recorded traces post-execution. Get more details [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer).

## Best Practices

Here are some recommended best practices when using this framework:

- **Use Utility Functions**: Whenever possible, use the [Utilities](docs/Utilities.md) functions provided in the framework instead of directly using Playwright methods. These utility functions are designed to simplify common tasks and make your tests more readable and maintainable.

- **Feedback on Utility Functions**: If you find that a utility function for a specific action or assertion is missing, please provide feedback so we can continue to improve and expand our utility Functions. Meanwhile, temporarily use the corresponding Playwright method combined with `getPage` from `@PageSetup` for a specific task, the utility function is not available. Replace these with newly added utility functions once they are available.

- **Conditional Statements**: Instead of manually implementing waits, use functions like `isElementVisible`, `isElementChecked` from [elementutils](docs/Utilities.md#elementutils). These functions automatically wait for the element to become visible, with customizable timeout options. It's advisable to avoid using these for assertions; instead, utilize [AssertUtils](docs/Utilities.md#assertutils) wherever possible.

- **Retrieving Text and Input Values**: To fetch texts or input values, consider functions like `getAllTexts` and `getAllInputValues` from [elementutils](docs/Utilities.md#elementutils). These methods come with built-in waits, ensuring they only proceed once an element is available, preventing premature returns of an empty Array<string>.

- **clickandNavigate vs click**: If a click action triggers page navigation, use the `clickandNavigate` utility function instead of the `click` function. `clickandNavigate` function includes built-in checks for frame navigation and waits for a new page to load. Use the `click` function if it is an Ajax call when you don't navigate to a different page.

- **Fill vs Type**: Use the fill utility function as default to fill form fields. Use type when you want to simulate typing character by character, such as when testing auto-search suggestions or autofill features. [Playwright type documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#type-characters)

- **Web-First Assertions**: Prioritize using playwright web-first assertions in your tests instead of jest or other library assertions. [Playwright Web First Assertions documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices#use-web-first-assertions)

- **Soft Assertions for Non-Critical Checks**: Use a soft assertion when a test assertion isn't critical, allowing the test to continue and fail at the end. For critical assertions, use a hard assertion i.e. the default assertion. [Playwright Soft Assertions documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#soft-assertions)

- **Backticks for Xpath & CSS**: Always use backticks for Xpath & CSS selectors so that you can use single & double quotes together if needed without any escape characters.

- **Playwright's Inbuilt Features**: Playwright comes with a wide range of inbuilt features. Make sure to utilize these as needed.
  - [Local Webserver](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver)
  - [Mocking](https://playwright.dev/docs/mock)
